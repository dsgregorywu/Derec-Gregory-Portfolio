Hello!

Welcome to my Portfolio. I'm a Data Science/Computer Science/Music student at Willamette University.

In here are many of my projects for classes, work, passion projects, and other miscellaneous files I've produced.

I also happen to be an award winning acappella arranger/composer! Under finished scores, you can find some of my favorite songs I've arranged :)
