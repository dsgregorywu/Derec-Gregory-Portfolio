Hello!

Welcome to my Portfolio. I'm a Data Science/Computer Science/Music student at Willamette University.
In here are many of my projects for classes, work, passion projects, and other miscellaneous files I've produced.
Also, under finished scores, you can find some of my completed arrangements.
